## Rules::Game Situation
We find ourselves in the picturesque village of DÃ¼sterwald. But the idyll is deceptive. For some time now,
a pack of werewolves has been up to no good, and every night a
villager falls victim to their insatiable hunger. In an effort to eradicate the evil, the villagers
resort to self-help, and the once tranquil place becomes the stage for a bitterly fought
battle for naked existence.
