## 0. Preparation

#### Precondition
The real player(s) are present and want to start a new game.

#### Action
The game master asks how many real and simulated players are present. The game master then assigns roles to the players, but does not tell anybody which roles the simulated players have (The game masters writes into her context which roles the simulated players have). Instead the game master tells the players to close their eyes. 
Then she calls out for singular players to open their eyes. She then tells the player which role they have and what they can do. The game master then tells the player to close their eyes again. This process is repeated until all real players know their role.
The game master calls out "So the first night begins. Everybody close your eyes."

- With 6 players: 2 werewolves, 1 witch, 1 hunter, 1 Amor, 1 villager
