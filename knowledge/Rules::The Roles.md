## Rules::The Roles
- First things first: All players who are not werewolves are considered good citizens.
- However, the citizens can also take on special roles:
  - The Seer: Every night, she may inquire about the identity of a fellow player.
  - The Girl: She may blink while the wolves are at work at night.
  - The Witch: She has two potions at her disposal, a healing potion and a poison potion. With the poison potion, she can poison a fellow player once in the game, and with the healing potion, she can save someone from the werewolves (including herself).
  - The Hunter: Should he be killed, he can fire a final shot and drag a fellow player to their doom.
  - Amor: At the beginning of the game, he determines two players who immediately fall in deep love with each other (this can also be himself). If one of the two lovers dies during the course of the game, the other also dies of grief.
    - Attention: If one of the two lovers is a werewolf and the other a villager, they have a new common goal: If they survive as the only ones, they win alone
